# Surfs_up

## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with data for both June and December in Oahu, HI as he prepares to invest in a surf and ice cream shop. The June and December analysis will help to decide whether investing in this particular shop with be sustainable year round due to temperatures.

Findings: 
- Temperaures are gathered from weather stations more frequently in the summer time than in winter 
- The average temperature in June is only 4 degrees higher than in December 
- The maximum temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than in December 
- the minumum temperature in June is 9 degrees higher than in December 

## Summary
Due to the very minimal difference in average temperature, I think that a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu would be a worthwhile year-round business investment. In order to confirm that it is indeed worthwhile, I think there should be some additional queries that are worth performing. The first is to also measure water temperature. The water temperature in June could siginificantly differ in the summer time than in the winter. The outside temperature may stay the same and may be bearable, but the water temperature could be much colder and patrons may be less likely to actually get in the water. Similiar to water temperature, wind speed has a significant impact on the water and weather in the winter time. Increased wind speed in the winter can create higher and more dangerous waves, leading to less patrons getting into the water (or at least the less experienced).
